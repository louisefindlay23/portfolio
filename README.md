# Louise Findlay's Portfolio Site

[![louisefindlay.com](https://github.com/louisefindlay23/portfolio/assets/26024131/793fff1a-3c4f-4acd-865c-4bfe2061cc87)](https://louisefindlay.com)

## Purpose

Develop a website that showcases all my work and projects to act as hub for my other sites and social networks.

## Technologies

The site is built with the Astro framework and deploys to Netlify as a statically generated site. The site uses Astro's content collections to generate and display Work and Projects from Markdown files using Zod as the schema. The site uses the `astro-icon` package to display icons using the `@iconify-json/mdi` icon set. Netlify Forms powers the contact form.
