Created Spyrath Dev to design and develop websites, catering to businesses at any level of their journey from those just starting out to established small to medium enterprises looking to grow further.

Build client's sites using WordPress and Shopify to easily create branded designs and implement advanced functionality such as e-commerce, events, and memberships.

Provide ongoing support through website care plans to ensure sites continue to be fast, updated, and secure.

Publish guides to empower non-technical users to learn more about their websites and other technical areas such as email hosting and domains. Also write about useful developer tools and self-hosting applications.
