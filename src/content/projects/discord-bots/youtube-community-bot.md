## Problem

YouTube doesn't consistently notify subscribers of new YouTube community posts. On some devices, you can't even read YouTube community posts.

## Solution

YouTube Community Bot solves the problem of notifying subscribers of your YouTube communty posts. Install YouTube Community Bot on your Discord Server and YouTube Community Bot will monitor your YouTube channel and post any new community post content.

I used the third-party YouTube Operational API to access YouTube community posts and Discord.js to send messages to a Discord server channel.
