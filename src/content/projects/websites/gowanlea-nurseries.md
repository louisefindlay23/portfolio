## Problem

Gowanlea Nurseries's old Shopify store was built using a propertiery theme and custom Liquid templates. Their legacy theme hampered customisibility and they struggled to update the site design to reflect modern trends and add new features.

## Solution

I rebuilt the Gowanlea Nurseries store using Whisk, a 2.0 compatible theme. Changing theme unlocked Shopify's sections feature which allowed pre-built sections to appear on any page. Using full-width images and a new responsive layout, the Gowanlea Nurseries store was transformed from black and white to their new green and pink brand colours.

I integrated Fera.ai to incorporate their Facebook and Google My Business reviews and auto request reviews from their future customers to provide social proof.
