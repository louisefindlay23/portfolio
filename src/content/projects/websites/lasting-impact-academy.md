## Problem

Lasting Impact Academy were looking for a learning management system that supported a one-off fee and subscription pricing model and allowed group leaders to buy bulk licenses and manage seats in their organisation.

## Solution

Our research showed no hosted platform could support their group leader management model so I developed a custom LearnDash and WooCommerce platform that enabled group leaders to manage their own employees training, buy bulk licenses and pay a one-off fee and subscription to the platform.
